## Last three _Suras_ of the _Quran_

This uses [_Raqq_](/raqq/english) typeface.

The pages are laid out following the layout of Kufi _mushafs_, where _sura_ titles are written in gold and outlined with a darker color. Letters in _sura_ titles are also dotless, and the text is void of vowel marks, and with eliminated inter-letter space to the point of overlap at times

While _sura_ body starts with _basmala_ immediately followed by the text of the _sura_ without a separator. And there is space between calligraphic syllables equal to the inter-word space, so for example in the _basmala_ of the first _sura_ the space between the first two words is the the same as the space between the first two letters of the second word.

Text lines are broken between calligraphic syllables, so we see the first line of the first _sura_ that the line is broken inside the last word of the _basmala_.

Vowel marks are shown as red, rounded dots, while diacritical dots are rectangular in the same color as the letters.

For _ayah_ marks, ornamental gold dots are used, with each five _ayahs_ marked with a big ornamental circle with the word “خمس” (five) inside it written in a style similar to _sura_ title.

And we see excessive use of elongation to justify the text lines, even when it is not really needed. For example, in the first line of the first _sura_ the word second to last of the _basmala_ is excessively elongated, causing the line to be broken in the middle of the last word. We also see excessive elongation in the last line of the same _sura_.

![Amiri font](/assets/images/amiri/banner.jpg "Amiri font")

Amiri is a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style for typesetting books and other running text.

Amiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20<sup>th</sup> century by Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is named.

The uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the beauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces that were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.

Amiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic typesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly available form.

Amiri is a free, open source project that everyone is encouraged to use and modify. See the [license](#license) for more details.

## Font features

Amiri supports a large number of Arabic characters supported by Unicode, which includes support for Quranic notation as well as many languages that use the Arabic script. The font also provides a wide range of OpenType features. Please refer to the [font documentation](./documentation/Documentation-Arabic.html) that describes many of these features.

## Participation

All contributions are highly appreciated, you can help by:

**Testing the font** and reporting any issues or suggesting improvement, especially if you are a native speaker of any language using Arabic script other than Arabic language.

**Improving glyph outlines** and adding more variants, especially if you have experience with Arabic calligraphy.

**Supporting the project**. If you like the font and use it, I don’t mind receiving an email telling me so, and maybe some words of admiration `:)` You can also spread the word, the more people using it, the more the incentive to develop it more and more.

## Reporting issues

We use a bug tracker where bugs reports and other suggestions should be sent.

_Alif Type_ the online home for my, _Khaled Hosny_, typefaces. It is a virtual type foundry, in the sense that there no physical place, a company, or employees, it is just me doing things I love mostly in my spare time. My typefaces are all free, and open source.

I specialize in making typefaces for the Arabic writing system, as well as typefaces for typesetting math.

My involvement with type design is centered around the idea that we should adapt and develop the technology to meet the needs and aesthetics of Arabic script in a digital world, instead of simplifying the Arabic script to fit into a mold formed by technical limitations.

I don’t like to do things the easy way as I find tha boring, so there is always some technical challenge I want to tackle or a new technique I want to try behind every typeface I make. There is always a story behind each one of them.

Besides making free and open-source typefaces, I also provide custom type design, font engineering, and font tools development services for others.

_Alif Type_ is a type foundry that specializes in Arabic and mathematical typefaces.

_Alif Typeâ€™s_ vision is to adapt and develop technology to meet the needs and aesthetics of Arabic script in a digital world instead of simplifying the Arabic script to fit into a mold formed by technical limitations. _Alif Type_ typefaces often pioneer using type design technologies in novel ways, and we always try to push the technology forward for the benefit of Arabic type users and designers.

_Alif Type_ develops many free and open-source typefaces and offers custom type design services, as well as font and font tools development for others.

_Alif Type_ was founded by Khaled Hosny, an Egyptian based in Cairo. Khaled studied medicine and worked as a doctor for a while before pursuing a career in type design and development, as well as developing text layout and font handling software. Khaled is an active contributor to many free and open-source projects, especially in areas related to Arabic support. You can read more about Khaled Hosny on [his website](https://khaledhosny.com).
